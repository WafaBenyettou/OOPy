"""
Objective: Understand the concept of abstract classes and how to use them in object-oriented programming.

An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and 
often includes one or more abstract methods. 
Abstract methods are methods that are declared, but contain no implementation. 
Abstract classes are meant to be subclassed, and the abstract methods should
 be implemented in the derived classes.
